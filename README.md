# Nucleosome profiling

Using Griffin (Doebley, AL., Ko, M., Liao, H. et al. A framework for clinical cancer subtyping from nucleosome profiling of cell-free DNA. Nat Commun 13, 7475 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-35076-w)


Done on ULP-WGS and 30X WGS data


Followed by downstream analysis that includes quantile normalization and statistical analysis to identify which transcription factors have different activity between disctinct groups of tumor samples.
